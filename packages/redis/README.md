# redis

Not used right now.  Will eventually refactor `server`'s Session auth from [CookieSessionStore](https://docs.rs/actix-session/0.6.2/actix_session/storage/struct.CookieSessionStore.html) into [RedisActorSessionStore](https://docs.rs/actix-session/0.6.2/actix_session/storage/struct.RedisActorSessionStore.html).  Removed from the `docker-compose` until then.
